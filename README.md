# anti-programming
An unconventional way to write a program by telling what NOT to do

# Status
Concept / Idea

# Origin
When develop a software, regardless of small or big, there always be some bugs in the code.
Wouldn't it be better if we have a language that just feed by give them bugs and let them produce software?

# Key Concepts
- A programming language that only tells what NOT to do
- Unit test driven
- Automatically infered

# Rough Language Usage
1. Given a set of inputs
2. Write test for invalid cases
3. Run the compilation sequence (this would take quite a long time)
4. And you've got a working software!
